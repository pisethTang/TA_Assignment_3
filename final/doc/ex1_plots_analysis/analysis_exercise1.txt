    1+1 EA
The 1+1 EA algorithm shows a rapid initial improvement in fitness but quickly converges and plateaus. Its probabilistic mutation mechanism allows a balance between exploration 
and exploitation on simple, unimodal problems. As seen in the plot, it tends to stagnate within local optima, making it less effective for larger or multimodal problems.

    Designed Genetic Algorithm (Designed GA)
The Designed GA demonstrates steady improvement over time without reaching a plateau within the given budget. The use of a population, crossover, and mutation promotes 
exploration but introduces computational overhead. While this approach is advantageous for complex problems and larger budgets, it may yield less efficient performance on 
simpler problems compared to other algorithms.

    Random Localised Search (RLS)
RLS exhibits a very similar performance curve to the (1+1) EA, with a rapid rise in fitness followed by an early plateau. This behaviour results from its simple one-bit 
mutation mechanism, which enables efficient local optimisation but limited exploration. Consequently, it performs well on simple, unimodal problems but struggles with 
complex or multimodal landscapes.

    Comparison of Algorithms
Comparing all three algorithms, both the (1+1) EA and RLS achieve strong early results followed by stagnation, indicating efficient exploitation but limited long-term 
exploration. In contrast, the Designed GA improves more slowly but continues progressing within the given budget, reflecting its greater exploration capacity. 
Overall, the (1+1) EA and RLS are more effective for simple, unimodal problems, while the Designed GA is better suited for complex or multimodal optimisation tasks.
